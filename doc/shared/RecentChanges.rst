**Major Features**

SUNDIALS now has official Python interfaces! With this release, we are shipping a **beta version** of
the sundials4py Python module (created with nanobind and litgen). sundials4py provides explicit
interfaces to most features of SUNDIALS. 

**New Features and Enhancements**

The functions ``CVodeGetUserDataB`` and ``IDAGetUserDataB`` were added to CVODES
and IDAS, respectively.

**Bug Fixes**

The interface to Ginkgo batched linear solvers has been updated to fix build
errors when using 64-bit index types. Note, only the batched dense matrix in
Ginkgo is currently compatible with 64-bit indexing (as of Ginkgo 1.10).

The SPRKStep module now accounts for zero coefficients in the SPRK tables,
eliminating extraneous function evaluations.

A bug preventing a user supplied :c:func:`SUNStepper_ResetCheckpointIndex`
function from being called was fixed.

The Kokkos N_Vector now properly handles unmanaged views. Previously, if a
Kokkos ``N_Vector`` was created from an unmanaged view, the view would become a
managed view and the data would be freed unexpectedly.

**Deprecation Notices**

``SUNDIALSFileOpen`` and ``SUNDIALSFileClose`` will be removed in the next major release. 
Use :c:func:`SUNFileOpen` and :c:func:`SUNFileClose` instead.

The ``Convert`` methods on the ``sundials::kokkos:Vector``, ``sundials::kokkos::DenseMatrix``,
``sundials::ginkgo::Matrix``, ``sundials::ginkgo::BatchMatrix``, ``sundials::kokkos::DenseLinearSolver``,
``sundials::ginkgo::LinearSolver``, and ``sundials::ginkgo::BatchLinearSolver`` classes have
been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. The method ``get``, should
be used instead.

The ``CSC_MAT`` and ``CSR_MAT`` macros defined in ``sunmatrix_sparse.h`` will be removed in
the next major release. Use ``SUN_CSC_MAT`` and ``SUN_CSR_MAT`` instead.

The ``N_Vector_S`` typedef to ``N_Vector*`` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
