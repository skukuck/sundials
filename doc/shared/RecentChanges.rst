**Major Features**

**New Features and Enhancements**

ARKODE now allows users to supply functions that will be called before each internal
time step, after each successful time step, after each failed time step, before
right-hand side routines are called on an updated state, and/or once each internal
stage is computed (:c:func:`ARKodeSetPreprocessStepFn`,
:c:func:`ARKodeSetPostprocessStepFn`, :c:func:`ARKodeSetPostprocessStepFailFn`,
:c:func:`ARKodeSetPreprocessRHSFn`, and :c:func:`ARKodeSetPostprocessStageFn`).
These are considered **advanced** functions, as they should treat the state vector as
read-only, otherwise all theoretical guarantees of solution accuracy and stability
will be lost.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a CMake bug where the SuperLU_MT interface would not be built and
installed without setting the ``SUPERLUMT_WORKS`` option to ``TRUE``.
