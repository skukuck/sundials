**Major Features**

**New Features and Enhancements**

Multiple minor updates were made to the ARKODE package.  We removed an extraneous
copy of the output vector when using ARKODE in ``ARK_ONE_STEP`` mode.  We
standardized calls to the user-supplied right-hand-side functions so that these
are provided the user-supplied solution vector passed to :c:func:`ARKodeEvolve` whenever
possible -- the notable exceptions are the Hermite temporal interpolation module,
the provided preconditioners ARKBANDPRE and ARKBBDPRE, banded or dense linear
solvers with automatically-approximated Jacobian matrices, iterative linear solvers
with automatically-approximated Jacobian-times-vector product, temporal root-finding,
discrete adjoint modules in ARKStep or ERKStep, the SPRKStep stepper, and LSRKStep's
use of the automated dominant eigenvalue estimation module.  The default numbers of
stages for the SSP Runge--Kutta methods :c:enumerator:`ARKODE_LSRK_SSP_S_2` and
:c:enumerator:`ARKODE_LSRK_SSP_S_3` in LSRKStep were changed from 10 and 9, respectively,
to their minimum allowable values of 2 and 4.  Users may revert to the previous values by
calling :c:func:`LSRKStepSetNumSSPStages`.

ARKODE now allows users to supply functions that will be called before each internal
time step, after each successful time step, after each failed time step, before
right-hand side routines are called on an updated state, and/or once each internal
stage is computed (:c:func:`ARKodeSetPreprocessStepFn`,
:c:func:`ARKodeSetPostprocessStepFn`, :c:func:`ARKodeSetPostprocessStepFailFn`,
:c:func:`ARKodeSetPreprocessRHSFn`, and :c:func:`ARKodeSetPostprocessStageFn`).
These are considered **advanced** functions, as they should treat the state vector as
read-only, otherwise all theoretical guarantees of solution accuracy and stability
will be lost.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a CMake bug where the SuperLU_MT interface would not be built and
installed without setting the ``SUPERLUMT_WORKS`` option to ``TRUE``.
